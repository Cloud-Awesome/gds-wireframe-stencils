# gds-wireframe-stencils

Basic stencils to create quick GDS wireframes in Visio or PowerPoint etc.

Used to quickly throw together the flow of pages in a wireframe using patterns from the Government Digital Service (GDS)

Repo includes 
- a Visio template file 
- a PowerPoint deck with images and descriptions of each stencil
- a PowerPoint deck with the original drawings that can be amended as required
