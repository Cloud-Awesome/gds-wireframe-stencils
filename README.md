# gds-wireframe-stencils

Basic stencils to create quick GDS wireframes in Visio, PowerPoint etc. or print out to stick on the wall in a design workshop

Used to quickly throw together the flow of pages in a wireframe using patterns from the Government Digital Service (GDS)

Repo includes 
- a Visio template file ('GDS Stencils.vssx')
- a PowerPoint deck with images of each stencil in you don't want to use Visio ('GDS Stencils.pptx')
- a PowerPoint deck with the original drawings that can be amended as required  ('PageIconDesigns.pptx')
- a Word document of printable stencils for paper-based prototyping (coming later, for now use the stencils pptx)
